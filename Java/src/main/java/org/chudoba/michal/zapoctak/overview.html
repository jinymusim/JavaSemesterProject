    <p> Program is divided into individual packages that<br>
        ensures that the game logic and game play are independent.<br>
    </p>
    <p> The packages come with abstract classes that shows <br>
        the base schema that needs to be followed if further expansion <br>
        is wanted.
    </p>
    <p> This isn't true for package Game that comes just with game logic <br>
        and package Util that only wraps Classes providing the schema for <br>
        communication between other packages.
